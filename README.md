Hi, Im Trent, a Web Developer and Tech Enthusiast. I have always been enthralled with tech and after working 8 years in the construction field have decided it was time to jump into something that I enjoy far more! I decided to attend a Web development BootCamp though UCSD (Extension) and will be continueing to pursue my hopes of becoming a Web Developer. This page Will be updated continuesly to show my progression of learning as well as in use to hopefully one day provide evidence to any future companies of my skills and abilities that I would be able to bring to any team.

I currently have knowledge with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
